# debug the below code so it works

mystring = hello
myfloat = 10.0
myint = 20.01

# testing code
if mystring = "hello":
    print("String: %f" % mystring)
if isinstance(myfloat, float) and myfloat = 10.0:
    print("Float: " myfloat)
if isinstance(myint, int) and myint = 20:
    print("Integer: %s" myint)
