# In this task you will analyze basic data with pandas

#Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd

# Assign it to a variable called users and use the 'user_id' as index
users = pd.read_table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justmarkham/DAT8/master/data/u.user', sep='|', index_col='user_id')

# Your tasks are below

# Task1
# See the first 25 entries

# Task2
# See the last 10 entries

# Task3
# What is the number of observations in the dataset?

# Task4
#What is the number of columns in the dataset?

# Task5
# What is the data type of each column?

# Task 6
# How many different occupations there are in this dataset?

# Task 7
# Summarize the DataFrame.

# Task 8
# Summarize all the columns
