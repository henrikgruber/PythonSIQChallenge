# Write a Python program to print yesterday, today, tomorrow.

#import datetime 
#today = 
#yesterday = 
#tomorrow = 
#print('Yesterday : ',yesterday)
#print('Today : ',today)
#print('Tomorrow : ',tomorrow)

Solution:


      import datetime 
today = datetime.date.today()
yesterday = today - datetime.timedelta(days = 1)
tomorrow = today + datetime.timedelta(days = 1)
print('Yesterday: ',yesterday)
print('Today: ',today)
print('Tomorrow: ',tomorrow)
