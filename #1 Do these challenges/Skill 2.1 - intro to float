# write a program that reads a float numbers and then you check if the number is < 100 - if yes, you print "Your number is smaller than 100" - otherwise, you print is higher than 100
# in addition, try to check if someone enters non-numeric character - display an error message
# example: input: 10.7 
# output: Your number is smaller 100
# example: input: abc
# output: Error - you have to enter float number
