Write a program that reads 3 integers and prints their sum.

You have the basic structure below / Note that # is a comment and should be removed

# a = input()
# Print a string:
# print(a)
NOTE: Python is syntax sensitive - that means that you have to use TAB for code indentation - eg. if you put a space before print(a) the code execution will fail
