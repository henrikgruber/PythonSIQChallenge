#Write a Python program to append a new item to the end of the array

# Once added, print the total length of the array together with the new array

#Original array: array('i', [1, 3, 5, 7, 9])                       

#Sample Output:
#Enter an element to append to the list: 11                          # New array length is: 6 array is:[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
