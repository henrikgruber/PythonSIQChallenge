#In this exercise, you will need to add numbers and strings to the correct lists using the "append" list method. 

# Create 3 lists: numbers, strings and names

# Add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" list, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings variable

# Add names John, Eric and Jessica to strings list

#Create a new variable third_name with the third name taken from names list, using the brackets operator []. Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access the second item in the list, its index will be 1.

# At the end print all lists and one variable created.
