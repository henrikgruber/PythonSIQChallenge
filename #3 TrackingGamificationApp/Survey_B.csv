Question
I exercise 2-3 times (or more) every week.
I pay attention to practice active sports (e.g. swimming, jogging, walking, biking) regularly.
I communte to work by foot or by bike. 
I make sure that I get enough exercise every day and work sitting as well as standing.
I sleep 7-8 hours a night.
I fall asleep very easily.
I don't wake up during the nights as my sleep is deep.
I feel that my sleep is very restorative.
